# HW1
Homework #1


I got rid of the unordered list

I changed the larger div's into a content section and a benefits secition

I used multiple selectors instead of having repeated code for the content and benefits section

I combined the image height in the float right and left classes

I added alt tags on the images

I took out some of the id's on the div's not sure if this was a good idea. If they are being called anywhere are they needed?

I deleted some of the unneeded parts of the pathway for the images
