# HW1
Homework #1


got rid of the unordered list

changed the header section to the header tag

changed the larger div's into a content section and an aside for the benefits

used multiple selectors instead of having repeated code for the content and benefits section

combined the image height in the float right and left classes

added alt tags on the images

took out some of the id's on the div's not sure if this was a good idea. If they are not being called anywhere are they needed?

deleted some of the unneeded parts of the pathway for the images

made the title Horiseon
